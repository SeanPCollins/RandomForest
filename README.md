# RandomForest
The Health Canada Random Forest (HCRF) is a free and open-source software of a QSAR model which trains in-house written decision trees (DTs). Models were built on curated data and standardized QSAR-ready chemical structures. The HCRF models are currently available in command line interface and a work in progress to make the features more user friendly in the future.
